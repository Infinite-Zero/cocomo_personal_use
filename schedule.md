# Schedule

| Item | Planned Time | Actual Time |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  Python code | 180 min  | 70 min  |
|  Java code | 120 min | 90 min  |
|  Python unit test | 180 min  | 160 min  |
|  Java unit test | 120 min  | 60 min  |

A rather noticable trend of our schedule was that our planned time was higher than our actual time. The most over exaggerated difference was with the Python coding section. The reason being that Python was an unfamiliar language and the estimated time to get to know python was inflated compared to the simplicity of the code. The other pats may also have been overstressed, but not to the same extent, since there was some prior knowledge, or higher complexity.

Our time planned was an average of 37% higher than our actual time taken.
