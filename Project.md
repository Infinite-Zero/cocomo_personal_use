# COCOMO project

The code provided on this assignment was confirmed to be similar with other sources, therefor we did not need to change any of the values.
* Compared source:

Since the sources had the same values, the numbers used between the codes were the same.

9. Can you use the COCOMO method to estimate the time this project will take? 

  Although it is possible to use the COCOMO method to estimate this project's time, COCOMO is better utilzied when working with a larger dataset of past projects. With a single project's worth of data this method is not particularly helpful.
