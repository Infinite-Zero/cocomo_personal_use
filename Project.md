# COCOMO project

3. Verify that the cost drivers table is correct. 

The code provided on this assignment was confirmed to be similar with other sources, therefor we did not need to change any of the values.
* Compared source:

8. Decide how you will keep the parameter values common between the two language versions

Since the sources had the same values, the numbers used between the codes were the same.

9. Can you use the COCOMO method to estimate the time this project will take? 

  Although it is possible to use the COCOMO method to estimate this project's time, COCOMO is better utilzied when working with a larger dataset of past projects. With a single project's worth of data this method is not particularly helpful.
